			<h2>What We Do</h2>
				<p>Being healthy doesn't have to be rocket science (which is great, because few of us are!) Yet, these days, with so much information out there from so many sources, it can be overwhelming to understand how to be as healthy as possible.</p>
			<ul id="list">
				<li>Are you overwhelmed by the amount of health information available online? </li>
				<li>Have you been told conflicting things about how to optimise your health? </li>
				<li>Have you been trying to get healthy, but not seen the results you want? </li>
				<li>Are you always chasing the newest fad in food, fitness and alternative health?</li>
			</ul>
				<h3>That's where we come in.</h3>
				<p>Leave the reading to us. Let us test all the new fitness fads out there. We'll try all the options when it comes to alternative health. New, whole foods? We've tasted them all.
